Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - 
powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It also supports MathJax if
I want to use any mathematical notations in the posts and inserting images or piece of codes is also very intuitive.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

For setting up a local jekyll server I followed 
[this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) tutorial.
