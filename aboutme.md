Hi, I am Prathmesh!

I am currently pursuing my masters degree in MSBA (Masters in Business Analytics) from The University of Texas at Austin and I will graduate in Mayâ€™2023. I also hold a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune. 

I have worked across techology, retail, and energy industry for ~6 years as a data scientist and analytics consultant. In these roles, I have built end to end analytics solutions for predictive maintenance, forecasting and app analytics helping companies optimize their inventory, reduce cost of operations, and increase customer retention.


I like solving real world problems using applied statistics, machine learning and computer programming.

When I am not working, I like to work out, cook gourmet food or read fiction.
