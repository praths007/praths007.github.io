<br>I am currently pursuing my masters degree in MSBA (Masters in Business Analytics) at The University of Texas at Austin. I also hold a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune. <br>

<br>I have worked across techology, retail, and energy industry for ~6 years as a data scientist and analytics consultant. In these roles, I have built end to end analytics solutions for predictive maintenance, forecasting and app analytics helping companies optimize their inventory, reduce cost of operations, and increase customer retention.<br>

<br>I like solving real world problems using applied statistics, machine learning and computer programming.<br>

<br>When I am not working, I like to work out, cook gourmet food or read fiction.<br>
