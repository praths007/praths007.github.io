Deep Learning is a method in which we try to mimic the human brain and use it within computers/machines. The human brain is one of the most powerful tools on the planet for learning, adapting skills and applying them.

Common models for this are:
* Artificial Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
* Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision
* Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis
* Self-Organizing Maps for Feature Extraction
* Deep Boltzmann Machines for Recommendation Systems
* AutoEncoders for Recommendation Systems
